          <p>Aggregate Data Drug Information System (ADDIS) is an evidence-based decision
            support system for health care policy decision making that concerns alternative
            treatment options. It has two core functions: the input, semantic annotation
            and sharing of structured data from clinical trials studies, and the
            creationand execution of analyses based on these data. Because both data
            and analyses are persistent and public, we believe that such an integrated
            system can improve the efficiency and transparency of systematic review
            and health care policy decision making by several orders of magnitude.</p>
          <p>The user interface uses question mark icon to provide help for specific
            terms,which when clicked will show a brief explanation as well as a link
            to further information in this manual.</p>

          <h2 id="your-account">Your account</h2>
          <p>You do not need an account to explore datasets and projects created by
            others.To create your own datasets and projects, you must create an account.</p>
          <p>
            <strong>Notice:</strong> Everyone will be able to view the datasets and projects
            you create in ADDIS.</p>
          <h3 id="creating-an-account">Creating an account</h3>
          <p>You can create an ADDIS account simply by signing in to ADDIS using your
            existing Google account. If you do not yet have a Google account,
            <a href="https://accounts.google.com/signup">create your Google account</a>
            before signing in to ADDIS. After you sign in for the first time, basic
            personal information (e.g. your name) is retrieved from Google and stored
            in ADDIS. It is currently not possible to change this information in
            ADDIS.
          </p>
          <h3 id="creating-a-profile-picture">Creating a profile picture</h3>
          <p>We use <a href="http://gravatar.com/">gravatar</a> to display profile pictures.
            If you already have a gravatar, and it is not being displayed, make sure
            it is linked to the primary email address of your Google account. If
            you do not have a gravatar, you can sign up for free to create a new
            one. To change your profile picture, simply update it on gravatar, and
            the new version should display in ADDIS within a few minutes; clear your
            browsercache to see the change immediately.</p>
          <h2 id="dataset-management">Dataset management</h2>
          <p>The data in ADDIS are organised into datasets. These are abstract containers
            for any number of clinical trials (or studies) and any number of high-level
            concepts that may correspond to concepts (such as drugs or outcomes)
            within these studies. Datasets function as repositories for these data,
            allowing analytical projects to to be based on them. Each dataset is
            owned by a particular user, who is the only one with the right to change
            it. It is possible, however, to copy studies from another dataset to
            yours and change or extend your copy. It is also possible to create analysis
            projects based on a dataset owned by someone else.
          </p>
          <h3 id="version-history">Version history</h3>
          <p>ADDIS datasets are stored using a versioning system. Each version of a
            datasetor study gets a unique identifier, and the history of a dataset
            can be investigated to see what changes were made over time.</p>
          <div class="figure">
            <img src="img/history.png" alt="History information" />
          </div>
          <p>Each specific version's instance of the dataset is always available. An
            analysisbased on a specific version of the dataset will not change if
            the dataset is changed, because the changes will create a new, different,
            version.Any changes to a study or the concepts list are temporary at
            first, until you are satisfied with your changes and opt to commit them.
            Committing makes your changes permanent, and lets you supply a short
            title and descriptive message to describe the changes that you made.
            After committing, the specific version of the dataset that includes your
            changes will be available to everyone forever.</p>
          <h3 id="study-oriented-versus-analysis-oriented">Study-oriented versus analysis-oriented</h3>
          <p>Traditional meta-analysis software treats study data in an
            <em>analysis oriented</em> way: you input study data into separate tables
            for each analysis, where the studies are rows. Such data tables are specific
            to each analysis, and the data can not easily be reused between analyses.
            By contrast, ADDIS stores data in a
            <em>study oriented</em> way, which means that each study extraction in ADDIS
            is a structured representation of what happened in that study, and what
            the outcomes were. Ultimately, study data should be extracted only once,
            and ADDIS uses matching rules to identify data eligible for inclusion
            in each analysis.</p>
          <h3 id="creating-a-study">Creating a study</h3>
          <p>From the dataset screen, it is possible to create new studies. There are
            currently three ways to create a study: 1. create an empty study, with
            a title and description of your choice, 2. import a study from <a href="https://www.ClinicalTrials.gov/">ClinicalTrials.gov</a>,
            3. copy a study from another dataset in ADDIS.</p>
          <p>To import a study, you need to find the NCT ID of the desired study on
            ClinicalTrials.gov:
          </p>
          <div class="figure">
            <img src="img/nct-id.png" alt="Finding the NCT ID of a study" />
          </div>
          <p>The system will show the most important details of the trial associated
            withthe NCT ID it is given, after which the actual import can take place.</p>
          <div class="figure">
            <img src="img/nct-import.png" alt="Importing a study from ClinicalTrials.gov" />
          </div>
          <p>The imported study will contain nearly all the data reported in ClinicalTrials.gov.
            However, ADDIS expects the data to be more structured than is often the
            case in ClinicalTrials.gov. You may need to clean up the data before
            the study is ready for analysis, as described in the section &quot;Study
            repair&quot; below. Most importantly, you will need to decide which groups
            count as arms (i.e. paths for subjects to go through the study)
          </p>
          <p>To copy a study, navigate to it either through the search screen, or by
            clicking on the user, dataset and study desired, and click the 'Copy
            Study' button at the top of the screen. The system will ask you which
            of your datasets the study should be copied to.</p>
          <div class="figure">
            <img src="img/copy-study.png" alt="Copying a study" />
          </div>
          <h3 id="study-input">Study input</h3>
          <p>After creating a study in one of your datasets, it is possible to extend
            and modify its information. Here is a brief overview of study entry.
            We provide <a href="#study-entry-example">a guided example</a> of study
            entry further below.
          </p>
          <p>Study information is divided in several subsections that can be input separately
            (Based on the <a href="https://www.cdisc.org/standards/domain-information-module/bridg"
              target="_blank">CDISC BRIDG model</a>):
            <ul>
              <li>Study characteristics, such as group allocation and population eligibility
                criteria.
              </li>
              <li>Arms and groups, which denote subpopulations of the study population
                with arms being used indicate separate paths for subjects to follow
                through the study, typically after randomization.
              </li>
              <li>Epochs, which indicate discrete time periods in the study's running
                time.
              </li>
              <li>Activities, which take place during the study, e.g. randomization,
                different treatments, or wash-out.
              </li>
              <li>The study design, which connects the arms, epochs, and activities:
                for each arm and epoch, an activity should take place.
              </li>
              <li>Measurement moments, which indicate a moment during the study at which
                data was gathered. Measurement moments are defined as taking place
                a certain period of time either after the beginning or before the
                end of an epoch (this time period can be zero).
              </li>
              <li>Variables, meaning which events and characteristics in the population
                are measured, e.g. mood improvement, blood pressure, or rate of dropouts.
                Variables an be of three types, namely population characteristics
                (e.g. gender, height), outcomes (pre-specified variables of interest,
                e.g. pain reduction or mortality), and adverse events (e.g. nausea
                or headache). For each variable it can be separately indicated at
                which measurement moment(s) it is measured.
              </li>
              <li>Measurement results (hidden by default, and can be shown by clicking
                the button on the variable of interest), indicating the values that
                were measured during the study. Measurements consist of up to two
                tables for each variable, one with results that are properly structured,
                meaning they are assigned to a group, variable and measurement moment,
                and one with non-conformant measurements that do not have an associated
                measurement moment (see
                <a href="#study-repair">the repair section</a> on how to fix this).
              </li>
            </ul>
          </p>

          <h3 id="concept">Harmonization</h3>
          <p>Different studies may use the same name to refer to different concepts.
            For example, one study may use “treatment response” to mean “a 50% or
            greater improvement of the MADRS score” while another may use it to mean
            “a 40% or greater improvement of the HAM-D score”. To allow cross-trial
            analyses based on a dataset, it is necessary to create concepts at the
            dataset level, and indicate for each concept from a trial to which dataset
            level concept it corresponds. This process is often called
            <em>harmonization</em> or
            <em>mapping</em> of the concepts, and is required for concepts including
            outcomes, treatments, and units of measure. For an example of concept
            creation, see <a href="#concept-creation">below</a> in the study entry
            example.
          </p>

          <h3 id="study-entry-example">Study entry example</h3>
          <p>To more clearly explain the study entry process and to highlight some potential
            pitfalls, we here go through the process of entering an example study
            into the system, namely <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Maurizio_Fava/publication/227227954_A_Double-Blind_Study_of_Paroxetine_Fluoxetine_and_Placebo_an_Outpatients_with_Major_Depression/links/57026ee108aec6e56fb336e0.pdf">the Fava et al. 1998 study on depression</a>            also included in our <a href="https://addis.drugis.org/#/users/3/datasets/65f9e23d-6e8d-4ccd-aacd-95b672520ce2">example dataset</a>            based on the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16172440">Hansen 2005 systematic
          review</a>.
          </p>
          <p id="concept-creation">
            For this demonstration we assume that we already know which concepts we're interested
            in using our analyses. Thus, we create them beforehand, so that mapping
            them in the study later is simple. The concept creation screen can be
            reached from the dataset overview. Creating a concept is as simple as
            entering its desired name and choosing its type. We don't distinguish
            between types of variables here because what is an adverse event for
            one type of treatment might be a desired for a different one (e.g. blood
            pressure increase). Note that it's not necessary to create different
            concepts for different dosages of the same drug &mdash; the same drug
            should always be the same concept, and distinguishing interventions by
            dosage can be done later, when creating an analysis project.
          </p>
          <div class="figure">
            <img src="img/create-concept.png" alt="Creating a concept" />
          </div>
          <p>
            After creating our study (choosing a handy short title such as "Fava et al. 1998")
            we navigate to it, and begin by entering the study characteristics, most
            of which can be found in the abstract.
          </p>
          <div class="figure">
            <img src="img/study-information.png" alt="Entering study information" />
          </div>
          <p>
            Second, we find the population information. Note the illustration is somewhat abridged
            to save space.
          </p>
          <div class="figure">
            <img src="img/population-information.png" alt="Entering population information" />
          </div>
          <p id="add-arm">
            Next, we enter the arms. These are abstract containers that divide the population
            into subpopulations, and correspond to that group's flow through the
            study protocol. You can give these any name you wish, but we recommend
            to name them according to the treatment this subpopulation will receive.
            If multiple arms involve the same treatment in different dosages, including
            the dosage in the arm name is also a good idea. The goal is to be able
            to distinguish arms at a glance from their name, and to be able to make
            an educated guess as to what happens in that arm.
          </p>
          <div class="figure">
            <img src="img/arms.png" alt="Entering arms" />
          </div>
          <p id="add-epoch">
            Now we enter the epochs. These are a set of abstract segments intended to represent
            the different parts in time of a subject's participation in a study.
            They may have an optional duration. It is possible to indicate for one
            epoch that it is the primary (treatment) epoch.
            <em>NB: For study data to be used in ADDIS analyses it is necessary to indicate
              which epoch is the primary treatment epoch.</em>
          </p>
          <div class="figure">
            <img src="img/epochs.png" alt="Entering epochs" />
          </div>
          <p id="add-activity">
            Next comes creating the study's activities. These represent everything that is done
            to the participants of the study. You can give them any name, but we recommend a descriptive one, e.g. 'Canaglifozin 1000mg QD + Metformin' for a combination/background treatment.
            The activities currently supported
            by ADDIS can be divided into two categories, abstract ones such as randomization
            and screening, and concrete (drug) treatment activities. In the image
            we show the definition of a drug treatment. After selecting the 'drug
            treatment' activity type, an 'add drug' button becomes available. ADDIS
            supports mixed treatment activities, and therefore lets the user add
            multiple drugs to a single treatment activity.
          </p>
          <p>
            <i class="fa fa-exclamation-triangle"></i> A common mistake is to add all the drug
            treatments for a study to a single treatment activity. Only drugs that
            are actually given together should be added to a single activity.
          </p>
          <p>
            There are several things to pay close attention to here. First, make sure to consistently
            choose the same name for the same unit (eg. don't mix mg and milligram).
            Second, it's only possible to actually create the treatment activity
            once you've finished the drug addition process (note that in the screenshot
            the bottom 'add' button is disabled because we haven't clicked 'add drug'
            yet).

          <div class="figure">
            <img src="img/fluoxetine-activity.png" alt="Adding a drug treatment activity" />
          </div>
          <p>
            We combine the definitions created above by filling out the study design, indicating
            which activity takes place for each arm in each epoch.
          </p>

            The study only reports measurements for baseline (i.e. before treatment, at the beginning
            of the main phase) and at the end of the main phase, so we define those
            two measurement moments as options for which to enter measurement data.
            <em>NB: For data to be automatically included in analyses by ADDIS it is
              necesary to select a measurement moment at the end of the main phase.</em>

            In ADDIS, data can be entered for three types of variables: Baseline (population)
            characteristics, Outcomes and Adverse Events. Here we show the example
            of creating and entering the data for the Age baseline characteristic.
            Age is measured at the baseline, i.e. the beginning of the main phase
            so we only select that measurement moment. It is stated in the paper
            that there is no significant different across arms for age, so we enter
            the same values for all groups. Note that it is possible to change the
            result properties for each variable, but not all result properties are
            supported for analysis yet.

          <h3 id="checklist-getting-to-analysis-ready">Checklist: getting to &quot;analysis ready&quot;</h3>
          <p>To ensure your studies are picked up for analysis in ADDIS, it is important
            that they are entered accurately and adhere to some best practices. Pay
            attention to the following:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>There are at least two arms</li>
            <li>The epochs have been defined, and a primary epoch has been chosen</li>
            <li>There is a measurement moment defined at 0 days before the end of the
              primary epoch (due to a limitation in how analyses are defined, only
              measurements at this measurement moment will be used in analyses)</li>
            <li>The study design table is complete: there is an activity selected at
              each cell of the table</li>
            <li>In the primary epoch, a (different) treatment activity has been selected
              for each arm (these will be recognized as the treatments being compared)</li>
            <li>The outcomes of interest have measurement data at 0 days before the end
              of the primary epoch</li>
            <li>The outcomes, drugs, and units of interest are mapped to dataset level
              concepts
            </li>
            <li>The measurement data is specified using the attributes recognized for
              analysis:
              <ul>
                <li>For continuous outcomes: mean, standard deviation, sample size</li>
                <li>For dichotomous outcomes: count, sample size</li>
                <li>For survival outcomes: number of subjects with event, total exposure
                  time
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h3 id="study-repair">Study repair</h3>
          <p>In general, when you import a study from ClinicalTrials.gov, it is likely
            that some of the data will not be structured correctly. Repair tools
            are available to correct several of these problems, as outlined below.
            These tools are accessed using the wrench icon (<i class="fa fa-wrench"></i>)
            in the user interface.</p>
          <p>Studies from ClinicalTrials.gov do not have arms, but only groups. You
            can change the appropriate groups into arms (preserving all associated
            data), by using the &quot;reclassify&quot; study repair tool.</p>
          <p>There might be duplicated or otherwise redundant outcomes, groups, or measurement
            moments. For example &quot;headache at week 13&quot; and &quot;headache
            at week 26&quot; would be considered redundant in ADDIS, because these
            are just &quot;headache&quot; at two different measurement moments. The
            study repair tools allow you to merge (combine) such duplicated objects
            into one.</p>
          <div class="figure">
            <img src="img/arm-merge.png" alt="Merging two duplicated groups" />
          </div>
          <p>Conversely, the data from ClinicalTrials.gov sometimes contain outcomes
            that actually report data on multiple outcomes, for example on several
            related (but distinct) biomarkers. These will have non-conformant measurements
            with row labels indicating which measurements belong to which outcome.
            You can separate such data into new outcomes.</p>
          <div class="figure">
            <img src="img/outcome-split.png" alt="Splitting up an outcome measure" />
          </div>
          <p>Where necessary, it is possible to assign non-conformant measurements to
            a specific measurement moment (note that you may first need to enable
            the measurement moment for that outcome).</p>
          <h2 id="analysis-projects">Analysis projects</h2>
          <p>In ADDIS, a project consists of definitions and analyses, and is based
            on a specific version of a specific dataset. Within a project, concepts
            are defined based on the concepts from the dataset, i.e. interventions,
            outcomes and covariates. Using these concepts and the data from the dataset,
            ADDIS automatically assembles analysis data tables. The project report
            tab gives an overview of the project and analyses, while the details
            tab provides a detailed view that allows you to edit the project.</p>
          <h3 id="creating-a-project">Creating a project</h3>
          <p>All projects must be based on a dataset. We have highlighted a few high
            quality datasets as 'Featured datasets' on the ADDIS home page. These
            are a good starting point to try out some of the analysis features in
            ADDIS without having to enter your own data. To create a project from
            a dataset, click a 'Create project' button and fill in in a name and
            description for your project.
          </p>
          <div class="figure">
            <img src="img/create-project.png" alt="Create a project" />
          </div>
          <p>The 'Create project' button is available on the featured datasets, on the
            dataset overview for a specific user, and when looking at a specific
            dataset. The created project will be based on the latest version of the
            dataset, except when viewing an older version of a dataset, in which
            case the project will be based on that version.</p>
          <h3 id="defining-concepts">Defining concepts</h3>
          <p>It is necessary to define concepts within a project to determine precisely
            which concept from the dataset we are interested in. In several cases
            it is also possible to restrict, refine and split out dataset concepts
            into precisely the project concepts we need. For example, you can create
            both the treatment concepts Paroxetine (high dose) and Paroxetine (low
            dose) based on the dataset concept of the drug Paroxetine, but with different
            dose restrictions. You may fill out a motivation explaining why you made
            this specific definition. Defining project concepts is done from the
            'Details' view of the project.</p>
          <h4 id="defining-outcomes">Defining outcomes</h4>
          <p>At the moment, outcome definition is simple: select an variable concept
            from the dataset (population characteristic, adverse event or endpoint),
            and choose the name under which to use it in the project.</p>
          <h4 id="defining-units"> Defining units</h4>
          <p>The definition of a unit is a combination of a metric multiplier and a
            dataset level unit concept e.g., milli and gram.</p>
          <h4 id="defining-covariates">Defining covariates</h4>
          <p>Covariate definition is simple: select which covariate to use (either a
            population characteristic or a study characteristic), and choose the
            name under which to use it in the project.</p>
          <h4 id="defining-interventions">Defining interventions</h4>
          <p>Intervention definition is potentially the most complex of the project
            concept definitions. Interventions can have dose-restrictions placed
            on them, or can be defined as combinations of previously-defined interventions.
            To create a simple intervention, select which drug concept from the dataset
            to use, and choose the name under which to use it in the project. To
            create a dose-restricted intervention, click the 'Dose-restricted' tab
            in the intervention creation dialog. Here, besides choosing the desired
            name, you can choose the type of dose the intervention should have, as
            well as set upper or lower bounds for the dosages.</p>
          <div class="figure">
            <img src="img/define-intervention.png" alt="Defining a dose-restricted intervention"
            />
          </div>
          <p>To create a combination intervention, click the 'Combination intervention'
            tab in the intervention creation dialog. Here, besides choosing the desired
            name, you choose the already-defined interventions of which the new intervention
            is a combination.</p>
          <h3 id="project-report">Project report</h3>
          <p>The project report view shows an overview of the project's definitions,
            and the most important results of each analysis that has been performed
            within the project. It lets you compare and contrast the results of analyses
            without needing to navigate to each analysis' model results individually.
            First, an overview of the defined concepts is shown (outcomes, interventions,
            covariates). Second, for each evidence synthesis analysis the relative
            effects of the primary model are shown, as well as a list of the secondary
            models. Third, all benefit-risk analysis based on a single study are
            shown, with their effects table and rank acceptability plot. Fourth,
            all benefit-risk analysis based on evidence syntheses are similarly shown.</p>

          <h2 id="evidence-synthesis">Evidence synthesis</h2>
          <p>In evidence synthesis, results from multiple primary studies are pooled
            to derive an overall estimate. Evidence synthesis includes many methods,
            including pair-wise meta-analysis, network meta-analysis, and meta-regression.</p>
          <p>Although this manual contains a brief introduction to the terminology and
            methodology, it is not a complete guide to evidence synthesis. For further

          <h3 id="creating-an-evidence-synthesis">Creating an evidence synthesis</h3>
          <p>To create an evidence synthesis, first make sure you have defined the outcome,
            interventions, and covariates you wish to include in your analysis. Then,
            on the analyses tab of the project overview, choose &quot;Add Analysis&quot;.
            In the pop-up dialog, enter a title for the new analysis, and choose
            &quot;evidence synthesis&quot; as the analysis type.</p>
          <p>After this, you will be taken to the analysis overview screen. Here, you
            select the outcome, interventions, and covariates you wish to include.
            Based on this, ADDIS will automatically populate an evidence network
            and evidence table. Check whether the evidence table includes the studies
            you were expecting. You may also use this screen to exclude any arms
            or studies that are inappropriate. Studies with only one included arm
            will be excluded automatically.
          </p>
          <p>Once you are happy with the evidence network and evidence table, you may
            use the &quot;Add model&quot; button to start defining models. As soon
            as you create the first model, the analysis and evidence table will be
            <em>locked</em>, meaning that you can not make further changes to it. Defining
            models will be described in more detail in the following sections.</p>

          <div id="gemtc-shared-content"></div>

          <h2 id="benefit-risk-analysis">Benefit-risk analysis</h2>

          <p>Benefit-risk analysis in ADDIS is based on the <a href="http://drugis.org/software/r-packages/smaa">SMAA</a>            package for the <a href="https://www.r-project.org/">R statistical software</a>.</p>
          </p>
          <h3 id="creating-a-benefit-risk-analysis">Creating a benefit-risk analysis</h3>
          <p>In ADDIS, benefit-risk analyses can be based on either a single study,
            or on a set of network (consistency) models.</p>

          <h4 id="creating-a-single-study-benefit-risk-analysis">Creating a single study benefit-risk analysis</h4>
          <p>To create a single study benefit-risk analysis, first make sure you have
            defined the outcomes and interventions you wish to include in your analysis.
            Then, on the analyses tab of the project overview, choose &quot;Add Analysis&quot;.
            In the pop-up dialog, enter a title for the new analysis, and choose
            &quot; Benefit-risk analysis based on a single study&quot; as the analysis
            type.
          </p>
          <p>After this, you will be taken to the analysis overview screen. Here, you
            select the criteria, alternatives, and study you wish to include. Based
            on this, when you press &quot;Perform MCDA Analysis&quot;, all options
            will become
            <em>locked</em>, and you will be taken to the MCDA module of ADDIS, where
            the benefit-risk analysis will take place, as described in the next sections.
          </p>

          <h4 id="creating-a-meta-benefit-risk-analysis">Creating a meta benefit-risk analysis</h4>
          <p>To create a meta benefit-risk analysis, first make sure you have defined
            the outcomes, interventions, and network meta-analyses you wish to include
            in your analysis. Also make sure that those network meta-analyses have
            consistency models that have been run, and use the outcomes and interventions.
            Then, on the analyses tab of the project overview, choose &quot;Add Analysis&quot;.
            In the pop-up dialog, enter a title for the new analysis, and choose
            &quot; Benefit-risk analysis based on meta-analysis&quot; as the analysis
            type.
          </p>
          <p>After this, you will be taken to the first step of the meta benefit-risk
            analysis creation process. Here, you select the alternatives, outcomes,
            and, for each outcome, which network meta-analysis and model you wish
            to include. When you are done, after pressing &quot;Next Step&quot;,
            you are taken to the second meta benefit-risk analysis screen. Here you
            set the baseline distributions for each included outcome, and see the
            corresponding absolute effects table. If a baseline distribution was
            already defined for an outcome's network meta-analysis model, it will
            be selected by default. You can set or override a baseline distribution
            by clicking the &quot;Set&quot; button, next to an outcome. This allows
            you to select the alternative you which to use as a baseline, and what
            the mean and standard deviation of the normal distribution should be.
            Once all distributions are set, the &quot;finalize&quot; button will
            become available, which
            <em>locks</em> all selections, takes you to the MCDA module of ADDIS where
            the benefit-risk analysis will take place, as described in the sections
            below.
